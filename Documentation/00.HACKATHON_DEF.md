# AI-Powered Citizen Concern Prioritization & Feedback Platform

Governments receive thousands of citizen complaints, feedback, and suggestions daily via different channels ‚Äî helplines, web forms, in-person visits.  
But many get **lost or delayed**, and citizens often get **no real updates** after submitting.

Challenges:

- No system-wide prioritization based on urgency or impact.
- Difficult to identify patterns across geographies or time.

## Our Solution: A Unified Digital Platform (Web + Mobile)

Powered by **AI/ML + NLP**, enabling citizens to log feedback, complaints, and ideas easily via:

- **Voice, Text, Regional Languages**
- **AI auto-categorization and prioritization** based on urgency, sentiment, and issue type
- **Transparent tracking**, like parcel tracking, so citizens know the status
- **Visual dashboards** for local councils/departments to act on top issues first
- **Real-time heatmaps** of issue trends by region

### Additional Features

- Reward system for top-voted citizen ideas that get implemented
- Analytics dashboard to monitor **SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) alignment**
