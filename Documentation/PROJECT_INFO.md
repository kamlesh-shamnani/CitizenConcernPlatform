## Project Overview

**Civica Message Hub** is a comprehensive digital platform that empowers citizens to report concerns and helps governments prioritize and manage public feedback efficiently using AI/ML technologies. The platform addresses the common challenge of governments receiving thousands of citizen complaints daily through various channels, many of which get lost, delayed, or lack proper prioritization.

- Limited citizen engagement and feedback mechanisms

### Core Solution Features
- **Unified PWA Platform**: Single responsive web app working seamlessly on all devices
- **AI-Powered Categorization**: Automatic categorization and prioritization using NLP
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Transparent tracking like parcel delivery systems
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual insights for government officials
- **Reward System**: Gamification with automatic point awards for civic engagement
- **SDG Integration**: Automatic UN Sustainable Development Goals tracking and progress monitoring
